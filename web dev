web development 
🌐 What is Web Development?

Web development is the process of building websites or web applications that run on the internet. It has two main parts:

Frontend (Client-side) – What users see and interact with (UI/UX).

Backend (Server-side) – What happens behind the scenes (logic, database, authentication).

Sometimes, a developer does both → called Full-Stack Development.

🖥️ 1. Frontend Development

Everything that runs in the browser.

Languages:

HTML → structure (skeleton of the page)

CSS → styling (colors, layout, design)

JavaScript → interactivity (animations, buttons, dynamic content)

Frameworks/Libraries:

React.js, Angular, Vue.js (for building dynamic UIs)

Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS (for styling faster)

👉 Example: When you click "Like" on Facebook, the frontend updates the button color immediately.

⚙️ 2. Backend Development

Everything that runs on the server.

Languages & Frameworks:

JavaScript → Node.js + Express

Python → Django, Flask

PHP → Laravel

Java → Spring Boot

Databases:

SQL → MySQL, PostgreSQL (structured data)

NoSQL → MongoDB (flexible data)

👉 Example: When you log in to Instagram, backend checks your username/password and fetches your profile.

🔗 3. Full-Stack Development

A full-stack developer handles both frontend & backend.

Common stack: MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

Others: MEAN, LAMP, Django + React, etc.

🛠️ 4. Tools & Skills

Version Control: Git & GitHub (track code changes).

Hosting/Deployment: Netlify, Vercel, AWS, Heroku.

APIs: REST, GraphQL (connect frontend ↔ backend).

Other skills: Responsive design, security basics, debugging.

🚀 5. Roadmap (Beginner → Pro)

Basics: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

Frontend framework: React or Angular.

Backend: Node.js/Express or Django/Flask.

Database: SQL + NoSQL.

APIs: Learn REST & GraphQL.

Deployment: Push projects online.

Build Projects: Portfolio, blog, e-commerce site, chat app.

✅ In short:

Frontend = What users see.

Backend = How it works.

Full-Stack = Both together.
